/*
    This style sheet is borrowed from the NetLogo User Manual.  However, some of the units were
    changed from em to px because Java's StyleSheet support is limited for relative units such as
    em and % (this will supposively improve with newer versions of the VM) - jrn 7/21/05
    BE VERY VERY CAREFUL when you alter this style sheet -- it's possible to put in
    innocent-looking things that work on some VM's but cause Java exceptions on other for example
    we were using "font-size: 125%" but it caused Java exceptions on Java 1.5 on Windows - ST

<p>This page was automatically generated by NetLogo 5.0.</p>

<p>The applet requires Java 5 or higher.
Java must be enabled in your browser settings.
Mac users must have Mac OS X 10.4 or higher.
Windows and Linux users may obtain the latest Java from

<p><hr>

<p><font size="-1">In order for this to work, this file, your model file
(sliderhider.nlogo), and the file NetLogoLite.jar
must all be in the same directory.  (You can copy NetLogoLite.jar
from the directory where you installed NetLogo.)</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">The applet will also need access to the 
sliderhider extension.
Copy the entire directory for each required extension into the same
directory as the applet.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">On some systems, you can test the applet locally on your computer
before uploading it to a web server.  It doesn't work on all systems,
though, so if it doesn't work from your hard drive, please try
uploading it to a web server.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">You don't need to include everything in this file in your page.
If you want, you can just take the HTML code beginning with
&lt;applet&gt; and ending with &lt;/applet&gt;, and paste it into any HTML
file you want.  It's even OK to put multiple &lt;applet&gt; tags
on a single page.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">If NetLogoLite.jar and your model are in different
directories, you must modify the archive= and value= lines
in the HTML code to point to their actual locations.
(For example, if you have multiple applets in different
directories on the same web server, you may want to put 
a single copy of NetLogoLite.jar in one central place and
change the archive= lines of all the HTML files to point
to that one central copy.  This will save disk space for
you and download time for your users.)</font></p>
